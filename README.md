## 🏗️ Data Architecture

The data architecture for this project follows the **Medallion Architecture** with **Bronze**, **Silver**, and **Gold** layers.

### Architecture Diagram 1

1. **Bronze Layer** – Stores raw data as-is from the source systems. Data is ingested from CSV files into the SQL Server database.  
2. **Silver Layer** – This layer includes data cleansing, standardization, and normalization processes to prepare data for analysis.  
3. **Gold Layer** – Houses business-ready data modeled into a star schema required for reporting and analytics.

## 🚀 Project Requirements

### Building the Data Warehouse (Data Engineering)

#### Objective  
Develop a modern data warehouse using SQL Server to consolidate sales data, enabling analytical reporting and informed decision-making.

#### Specifications  
- **Data Sources** – Import data from two source systems (ERP and CRM) provided as CSV files.  
- **Data Quality** – Cleanse and resolve data quality issues before analysis.  
- **Integration** – Combine both sources into a single, user-friendly data model designed for analytical queries.  
- **Scope** – Focus on the latest dataset only; historization is not required.  
- **Documentation** – Provide clear documentation of the data model to support both business stakeholders and analytics teams.

### BI: Analytics & Reporting (Data Analysis)

#### Objective  
Develop SQL-based analytics to deliver detailed insights into:
- **Customer Behavior**  
- **Product Performance**  
- **Sales Trends**

These insights empower stakeholders with key business metrics for strategic decision-making.
